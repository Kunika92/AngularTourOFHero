<!-- Binding expressions in the template that refer to properties of selectedHero — expressions
  like {{selectedHero.name}} — must fail because there is no selected hero. -->
<!-- When selectedHero is undefined, the ngIf removes the hero detail from the DOM.
  There are no selectedHero bindings to worry about. -->
<!-- When the user picks a hero, selectedHero has a value and
  ngIf puts the hero detail into the DOM.   -->
